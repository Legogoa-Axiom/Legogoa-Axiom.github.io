The team of 14 kids from all over Goa teamed up to participate and qualify for the semifinal stage by winning 4 of the six matches played.
The competition format facilitated learning in the domain of robotics, coding, 3D design, documentation, speaking skills, etc, and also helped in the overall development of a student participating in it.
The team learning journey is well documented on the
<a href=www.legogoa.in>website</a>
(built on GITHUB due to the efforts of Anay Kamat).
You can also check the voluminous documentation prepared by the team on its learnings and achievements. All done by 13-year-old kids.

Parents of all the team members chipped in to fund the team expenses and raised sponsorships.
Thanks to #FIRST for creating a fantastic format and I wish this format is replicated In an Indian context so that a maximum number of students in India can derive benefit from it.</p><p>#team #learning #share #tech #students #india #coding #robotics #github #design</p><h2 id=final-day-report-at-ftc>Final day report at FTC</h2><p>Today was the culmination of all our efforts put in action with the actual matches being played. We played six league matches within a span of 6 hours.
It was a dream run when we won the first three matches. We then lost the fourth match, won fifth and then lost the last one (4/6). We were placed 8th in the Raman division and we were elated that our mentor team Team sigma picked us as an alliance team for the semi finals.
We also manage to impress the jury and visitors to our stall and secured nomination as the best motivator team for the Raman division
Qualifying for semi finals and getting placed within top 15 in the first year of participating in FTC is an achievement that will now motivate us to perform better for the next edition .
We are also elated to see the success of our mentor teams from RoboFun Lab bagging most of the top awards.
But the biggest achievement has been the learning that the team members have gotten, motivating a bunch of kids from Chorao to witness first hand the excitement in such tournaments, and elation for parents to see their children succeed.
We would like to thank the Hon&rsquo;ble Chief Minister of Goa Shri Pramod Sawantand the Hon&rsquo;ble minister for IT Shri Rohan Khaunte for providing all the support and motivation.
Big Thanks for our sponsors Dempo group, Binani fibre, cloudstrats etc for the support</p><h2 id=report-and-glimpses-of-the-first-day-at-first-tech-challenge-india>Report and glimpses of the first day at First Tech Challenge India.</h2><p>The Outreach and documentation team set up the pit area with a display of our outreach activities, features of our robot etc.
The team also had activities for visitors and gave away prizes as well. The stall was popular amongst visitors due to the vibrant presentation and buzzing activities.
We cleared the robot inspection and field inspection after some last minute modifications. We also managed to get practice sessions to test out the robot
The matches schedule was announced very late on the day and then some technical delays caused disruption in the schedule. Hence our six league matches will be played on day two
Our scouting team did fantastic work with their fine detective minds to create a complete assessment of strengths of alliance and competitive teams.
The Chorao team led by Vincent Paul Toscano reached the venue to check out the live action
