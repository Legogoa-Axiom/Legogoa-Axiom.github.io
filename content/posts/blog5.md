We (Aniket Bhatikar and Samihan Pangam) conducted a workshop on 21 and 22 December 2022, 'Basic Electronics and Robotics', as a part of a fundraising initiative. This workshop was our first outreach activity. Our teammates Venkatesh, Shounak and Dhruv have also conducted various outreach activities across Goa. 

We conducted this workshop, especially for Mushtifund High School students. Our fee was Rs.500 per student. A total of 6 students had registered. We taught them the basics of electronics like LEDs, breadboards, Buzzers, motor drivers etc. We also explained to them the working of various sensors like Infrared sensors, Light dependent Register sensors, etc. After learning, they built four different robots (object follower, object avoidance, Light follower and Light avoidance) and two projects(touchless doorbell and Automatic hand Sanitizer) under our guidance.

 All students were very excited to learn and build the robots. We also taught them how to overcome various errors in robotics that most of us face.
