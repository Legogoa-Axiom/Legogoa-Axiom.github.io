Having fun is primary at Team Legogoa meetups and we had celebrations by cutting of a cake by the birthday boy Shounak. We had a twist with the cake cutting as shounak used a slider with a knife to cut the robot themed cake.

^We also had a serious monkey storming session as evident from the picture.

We were thinking of building a website which includes everyone's collaboration. Our team coach Saieesh Sir introduced us to GitHub and planned training sessions.

 17th December was our first training session on GitHub. In GitHub, everyone in a team can collaborate. It includes all the records of how the team had constructed a website i.e.how many have contributed. It also shows when and what changes a teammate has created on the website. Yesterday's session was just an introduction. We also built a small website using HTML.
