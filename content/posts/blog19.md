The Outreach and documentation team set up the pit area with a display of our outreach activities, features of our robot etc.
The team also had activities for visitors and gave away prizes as well. The stall was popular amongst visitors due to the vibrant presentation and buzzing activities.
We cleared the robot inspection and field inspection after some last minute modifications. We also managed to get practice sessions to test out the robot
The matches schedule was announced very late on the day and then some technical delays caused disruption in the schedule. Hence our six league matches will be played on day two
Our scouting team did fantastic work with their fine detective minds to create a complete assessment of strengths of alliance and competitive teams.
The Chorao team led by Vincent Paul Toscano reached the venue to check out the live action
