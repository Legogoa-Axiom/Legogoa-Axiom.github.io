On Sunday, the 4th of December Team Legogoa Axiom gathered at the house of our mentor, Saieesh Gandhi to discuss and understand the format, scoring system and components of the game.

With excellent presentations made by Viraj, Aniket, Sai Pranav and Vighnesh, helped us to understand rules of the game and triggered our thinking about our strategy in the tournament.

We are also very excited that the parts will be arriving in a few days time and we can build and program our robot soon.

Our website designed and put together by Aditya and Taksh went live.

Our young instructors Venkatesh, Shounak and Dhruv conducted a robotics workshop and raised ₹6000 to contribute to our sponsorship and hope to raise much more.
