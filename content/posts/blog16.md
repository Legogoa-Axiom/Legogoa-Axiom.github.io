## FIRST Robotics Competition

is the ultimate Sport for the Mind. High-school student participants call it “the hardest fun you’ll ever have.”
Under strict rules, limited time, and resources, teams of students are challenged to raise funds, design a team "brand," hone teamwork skills, and build and program industrial-size robots to play a difficult field game against like-minded competitors. It’s as close to real-world engineering as a student can get. Volunteer professional mentors lend their time and talents to guide each team.

Team Legogoa Axi0m is participating in the First Tech Challenge 2023-24 season and the National Level competition i.e. scheduled to be held in Feb-Mar 2024 in Pune.
