We were thinking of building a website which includes everyone's collaboration. Our team coach Saieesh Sir introduced us to GitHub and planned training sessions.

Yesterday was our first training session on GitHub. In GitHub, everyone in a team can collaborate. It includes all the records of how the team had constructed a website i.e.how many have contributed. It also shows when and what changes a teammate has created on the website. Yesterday's session was just an introduction. We also built a small website using HTML. 

The session was conducted by Shri Anay Kamat
