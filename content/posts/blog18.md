Today was the culmination of all our efforts put in action with the actual matches being played. We played six league matches within a span of 6 hours.
It was a dream run when we won the first three matches. We then lost the fourth match, won fifth and then lost the last one (4/6). We were placed 8th in the Raman division and we were elated that our mentor team Team sigma picked us as an alliance team for the semi finals.
We also manage to impress the jury and visitors to our stall and secured nomination as the best motivator team for the Raman division
Qualifying for semi finals and getting placed within top 15 in the first year of participating in FTC is an achievement that will now motivate us to perform better for the next edition .
We are also elated to see the success of our mentor teams from RoboFun Lab bagging most of the top awards.
But the biggest achievement has been the learning that the team members have gotten, motivating a bunch of kids from Chorao to witness first hand the excitement in such tournaments, and elation for parents to see their children succeed.
We would like to thank the Hon'ble Chief Minister of Goa Shri Pramod Sawantand the Hon'ble minister for IT Shri Rohan Khaunte for providing all the support and motivation.
Big Thanks for our sponsors Dempo group, Binani fibre, cloudstrats etc for the support
