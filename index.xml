High-school student participants call it ‚Äúthe hardest fun you‚Äôll ever have.‚Äù Under strict rules, limited time, and resources, teams of students are challenged to raise funds, design a team &amp;ldquo;brand,&amp;rdquo; hone teamwork skills, and build and program industrial-size robots to play a difficult field game against like-minded competitors. It‚Äôs as close to real-world engineering as a student can get. Volunteer professional mentors lend their time and talents to guide each team.</description></item><item><title>Register for FTC 2023-24</title><link>http://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/blog17/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/blog17/</guid><description>The preparations for the past 5 months culminated at the First Tech Challenge India championships held in March 2023 at Pune, India The team of 14 kids from all over Goa teamed up to participate and qualify for the semifinal stage by winning 4 of the six matches played.

We welcomed them and they were ecstatic to watch our robot in action and noted all the areas that could be improved. We worked on the robot till about 7 in the evening and that‚Äôs when the team-building exercises started where we played a few games which helped us get to know each other better.</description></item><item><title>Ftc workshop</title><link>http://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/blog13/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/blog13/</guid><description>The three day FTC workshop has been highly successful at multiple fronts. The team secured advice from a senior team about the gaps in the strategy and also improvements in design of the robot. We also got a good team bonding experience due to sessions by Expert Karuna Satardekar We managed good visibility with the visit of Honble Minister for Tourism and IT visiting us as Chief Guest.

Venkatesh , Sai Pranav and Avneesh were present.
Venkatesh and Avneesh, were working on fixing the robot. That was tightening the tyres along with the axcel, the bearing and the gears. We did this as the tyres were loose and were shaking and could make the robot unstable. This was a very tedious process. Venkatesh and I failed multiple times before we managed to get it right.</description></item><item><title>Build session</title><link>http://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/blog11/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/blog11/</guid><description>On Sunday the 8th Jan, we met physically at our mentor&amp;rsquo;s house. Viraj and Vighnesh conducted a session for the team members to learn about pull requests. Aditya, Aniket and Dhruv attended the session. Aniket even created a pull request regarding this outreach activity at Progress High School.
For the first building part of the chassis, the three of us were Sai Pranav, Viraj and Druv. We realised we did not have enough parts to make the strafer chassis last time because we had opened the assembly manual for the strafer chassis v5, but our kit was that of v4.</description></item><item><title>Awareness Session at Government Schools</title><link>http://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/blog10/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/blog10/</guid><description>I conducted a workshop to create awareness about various coding-robotics competitions held at the international/national/state level. It was a 3-hour workshop. The students from grade 5 to grade 10 attended the workshop. I conducted it at Progress High School (Government School) free of cost!
The students were very excited to attend. I got a chance to clear up various doubts. They also had a fear of learning robotics. After attending this workshop, this fear was gone.</description></item><item><title>Session on Engineering Notebook by Mr Ashwin Shah</title><link>http://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/blog9/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/blog9/</guid><description>On 4 January 2023,Mr Ashwin Shah, the mentor of team Sigma and many other FTC teams took a session to advise us on how to maintain the engineering notebook.
He explained to us that the engineering notebook is one of the most important aspects of advancing in the First Tech Challenge as it is the basis on which the judges would judge our work.
He advised us on how we should devote 3 to 4 days to our engineering notebook before beginning our builds by dividing ourselves into teams under the categories of engineering, outreach and fundraising and collect information from each group and filling it into a predefined template.</description></item><item><title>Workshops</title><link>http://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/blog8/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/blog8/</guid><description>Ponda Workshop

We had a twist with the cake cutting as shounak used a slider with a knife to cut the robot themed cake.
^We also had a serious monkey storming session as evident from the picture.
We were thinking of building a website which includes everyone&amp;rsquo;s collaboration. Our team coach Saieesh Sir introduced us to GitHub and planned training sessions.</description></item><item><title>Github sessions</title><link>http://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/blog3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/blog3/</guid><description>We were thinking of building a website which includes everyone&amp;rsquo;s collaboration.

Yesterday was our first training session on GitHub. In GitHub, everyone in a team can collaborate. It includes all the records of how the team had constructed a website i.e.how many have contributed. It also shows when and what changes a teammate has created on the website.</description></item><item><title>Fundraising initiatives</title><link>http://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/blog2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/blog2/</guid><description>In the true spirit of FIRST, three team members of Legogoa Axi0m 22855 decided to combine outreach and raising funds into one event and they did it successfully by conducting a nominally paid robotics workshop called ‚ÄúExplore the World of Robotics.
